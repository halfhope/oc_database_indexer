# OpenCart Database Indexer
[![License: GPLv3](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-GPL%20V3-green?style=plastic)](LICENSE)

This script automatically checks and adds missing indexes to your store's database tables. Queries with indexes execute much faster than those without, significantly reducing the load on the database server. The script includes 27 known indexes for 14 tables.
